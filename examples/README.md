## Relative sea level variation (m/yr)

We recommend the use of values between 0 and 35 m/kyr.

We have to distinguish between global (eustatic) and local relative sea level variations. Some local processes can trigger higher sea level changes very occasionally. An example of these processes is the loss of interstitial fluids due to extraction of water/gas/oil from the subsurface. The highest values of relative sea level associated to global processes happen during glaciation time. Donovan and Jones (1979) reported rapid rate of sea-level rise of up to 10 m/kyr. The most detailed analysis of sea-level variation is focused on recent times. Cronin (2012) reported values of varying rate of sea-level rise during the early Holocene from  as low as 6 m/kyr to up to 30-60 m/ kyr during brief periods of accelerated sea level rise. Values up to 40 m/kyr are also reported by Jakob et al (2020). Other studies show a maximum relative sea level variation of up to 27.5 m/kyr during the last post-glacial period (Fleming et al, 1998; Fleming, 2000; Milne et al, 2005).
For longer periods of time and for cases where the age of the target to be modelled is known, we recommend to check the eustatic relative sea level variation graphs proposed for Cretaceous (Haq, 2014), Jurassic (Haq, 2017), Triassic (Haq, 2018) and Paleozoic (Haq and Schutter, 2008) times.

## Sediment supply rate (m²/yr)

The sediment supply rate in BarSim is related to the net along-shore transport of sediment. There are studies that calculated the net longshore sediment transport rates in different coastlines of the world. Thunyaphun et al. (2023) calculated the sediment transport rates in the surf and offshore zones of the Ishikawa coast (Japan), a coastline dominated by wave and offshore currents, and they obtained values between 40000-120000 m³/yr/km, equivalent to 40-120 m²/yr in two dimensions. For the coastline of the Netherlands, longshore sediment transport rates of 60-70 m³/m/yr have been computed at 9 km from the coastline(Grasmeijer et al., 2019), uniform rates up to 175 m³/m/yr northward of Scheveningen (van der Hout et al., 2009), and up to 150± 60 m³/m/yr  in Callantsoog (Van Rijn, 1997). 
Longshore littoral drift of 635000m³/yr has been estimated for the Gold Coast in Queenslands (Australia) (GCCM, 2017), a 35-km long coastline. This is translated into a sediment supply of 18.1 m²/yr in two dimensions.  In this same coastline, measurements fluctuate between 450000 and 680000 m³/yr, 13-19.5 m²/yr sediment supply (Zarifsanayei et al, 2023). Studies on the Dutch coastline have reported alongshore sediment transport values of up to 150 ± 60 m²/yr (Van Rijn, 1997).
BARSIM has been used to constrained the environmental conditions that controlled the deposition of two parasequences of the Aberdeen Member, Blackhawk Fm of the Book Cliffs (Utah, USA) (Charvin et al, 2011). For this study, the sediment supply rate used varied from 0 to 80 m²/yr.
